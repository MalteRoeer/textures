Textures with deep learning


This is work in progress. The aim of this project is an elementry implementation of the texture detecting algorithms in Gatys et al. (2015).
The first steps in the project are the following:

Research the topic by reading existing articles, e.g.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576

Check out and run existing implementations of the algorithm, e.g.
